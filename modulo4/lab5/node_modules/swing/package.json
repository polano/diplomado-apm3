The swipe-left/swipe-right for yes/no input. As seen in apps like [Jelly](http://jelly.co/) and [Tinder](http://www.gotinder.com/), and [many others](http://www.saydaily.com/2014/09/tinder-swipe-and-media).\n\nGive it a [swing](http://gajus.com/sandbox/swing/examples/card-stack/)! and please [tweet it](https://twitter.com/intent/retweet?tweet_id=527505589732405248) if you like it. : )\n\n![Card stack example.](./README/card-stack.gif)\n\n## Contents\n\n* [Swing](#swing)\n    * [Contents](#swing-contents)\n    * [Usage Examples](#swing-usage-examples)\n    * [Use Case](#swing-use-case)\n        * [Single-Handed Navigation](#swing-use-case-single-handed-navigation)\n        * [Digestible Unit of Information](#swing-use-case-digestible-unit-of-information)\n        * [Data](#swing-use-case-data)\n    * [Quick Start](#swing-quick-start)\n    * [Configuration](#swing-configuration)\n    * [Methods](#swing-methods)\n        * [Throwing Card Out of the Stack](#swing-methods-throwing-card-out-of-the-stack)\n    * [Events](#swing-events)\n        * [Event Object](#swing-events-event-object)\n    * [Download](#swing-download)\n        * [Browser Bundle](#swing-download-browser-bundle)\n    * [Dependencies](#swing-dependencies)\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n* [Card stack](http://gajus.com/sandbox/swing/examples/card-stack/).\n* [Card stack](http://gajus.com/sandbox/angular-swing/examples/card-stack/) using [angular-swing](https://github.com/gajus/angular-swing/) module.\n* [Programmatically control](http://gajus.com/sandbox/swing/examples/card-state/) the state of the card.\n* [Indicate the state of the drop](http://gajus.com/sandbox/swing/examples/throw-confidence/) using `throwConfidence` and `direction` [event object](#event-object) properties.\n\nThe code for all of the examples is in the [./examples/](https://github.com/gajus/swing/tree/master/examples/) folder.\n\n[Raise an issue](https://github.com/gajus/swing/issues) if you are missing an example.\n\n## Use Case\n\nA collection of observations about the extended use case of the swipeable cards interface, that I found useful when considering the implementation.\n\n### Single-Handed Navigation\n\n> Mobile devices are frequently used on-the-go, which drastically increases the probability that you'll attempt to navigate apps using just one hand, with the key digit being the mighty thumb.\n> Instead of browsing endless lists for the hidden perfect piece of data — be it the right music for the moment, what to do tonight, or your next potential hookup — card-swiping turns decision making into a highly engaging Choose-Your-Own-Adventure game.\n\n– https://medium.com/@janel_az/small-data-why-tinder-like-apps-are-the-way-of-the-future-1a4d5703b4b\n\n### Digestible Unit of Information\n\n> [..] the \"card\" on a mobile device becomes more and more important as a digestible unit of information on a small screen for users who are on the go and mostly glancing through their apps before settling into the ones that truly engage them.\n\n– http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/22/mobile-apps-card-interfaces-and-our-opposable-thumbs/\n\n### Data\n\n> More than a scroll and perhaps even more than discrete taps themselves, cards create repetitive, deliberate, discrete decision moments over and over. And as the user swipes, you can learn.\n> The time they swipe, the speed they swipe, what they swiped, the geolocation where they swiped, and even how similar the results of that swipe are vs. a swipe earlier that session are all possibilities that are yielding smarter apps for you and me every day.\n\n– http://www.itsmakeable.com/unconventional-wisdom/good-user-experience-design-ux-can-do-what-now/\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```html\n<ul>\n    <li></li>\n    <li></li>\n    <li></li>\n</ul>\n```\n\n```js\nvar stack,\n    cards;\n\n// Prepare the cards in the stack for iteration.\ncards = [].slice.call(document.querySelectorAll('ul li'))\n\n// An instance of the Stack is used to attach event listeners.\nstack = Swing.Stack();\n\ncards.forEach(function (targetElement) {\n    // Add card element to the Stack.\n    stack.createCard(targetElement);\n});\n\n// Add event listener for when a card is thrown out of the stack.\nstack.on('throwout', function (e) {\n    // e.target Reference to the element that has been thrown out of the stack.\n    // e.throwDirection Direction in which the element has been thrown (Card.DIRECTION_LEFT, Card.DIRECTION_RIGHT).\n\n    console.log('Card has been thrown out of the stack.');\n    console.log('Throw direction: ' + (e.throwDirection == Card.DIRECTION_LEFT ?

Determines if element is being thrown out of the stack. | Element is considered to be thrown out when `throwOutConfidence` is equal to 1. |\n| `throwOutConfidence` | Invoked in the event of `dragmove`. Returns a value between 0 and 1 indicating the completeness of the throw out condition. | Ration of the absolute distance from the original card position and element width. |\n| `throwOutDistance` | Invoked when card is added to the stack. The card is thrown to this offset from the stack. | The value is a random number between `minThrowOutDistance` and `maxThrowOutDistance`. |\n| `minThrowOutDistance` | In effect when `throwOutDistance` is not overwritten. | 450. |\n| `maxThrowOutDistance` | In effect when `throwOutDistance` is not overwritten. | 500. |\n| `rotation` | Invoked in the event of `dragmove`. Determine the rotation of the element. | Rotation is equal to the proportion of horizontal and vertical offset times the `maximumRotation` constant. |\n| `maxRotation` | In effect when `rotation` is not overwritten. | 20. |\n| `transform` | Invoked in the event of `dragmove` and every time the physics solver is triggered. | Uses CSS transform to translate element position and rotation. |\n\nAll of the configuration parameters are optional. Refer to the source code of the [card](https://github.com/gajus/swing/blob/master/src/card.js) module to learn the parameters associated with every callback.\n\n## Methods\n\n```js\nvar stack,\n    card;\n\nstack = stack = Swing.Stack();\ncard = stack.createCard(HTMLElement);\n```\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `stack.createCard(element)` | Creates an instance of Card and associates it with the element. |\n| `stack.getCard(element)` | Returns card associated with an element. |\n| `stack.on(event, listener)` | Attaches an [event listener](#events). |\n| `card.on(event, listener)` | Attaches an [event listener](#events). |\n| `card.throwIn(x, y)` | Throws a card into the stack from an arbitrary position. `x, y` is the position at the start of the throw. |\n| `card.throwOut(x, y)` | Throws a card out of the stack in the direction away from the original offset. `x, y` is the position at the start of the throw. |\n| `card.destroy()` | Unbinds all Hammer.Manager events. Removes the listeners from the physics simulation. |\n\n### Throwing Card Out of the Stack\n\nUse the `card.throwOut(x, y)` method to throw the card out of the stack. Offset the position to whatever direction you want to throw the card, e.g.\n\n```js\ncard.throwOut(Card.DIRECTION_LEFT, 0);\ncard.throwOut(Card.DIRECTION_RIGHT, 0);\n```\n\nTo make the animation more diverse, use random value for the `y` parameter.\n\n## Events\n\nEvent listener can be attached to an instance of `Swing.Stack` or `Swing.Card` using the `on` method:\n\n```js\nvar stack,\n    card;\n\nstack = stack = Swing.Stack();\n\ncard = stack.createCard(HTMLElement);\n\ncard.on('throwout', function () {});\nstack.on('throwout', function () {});\n```\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `throwout` | When card has been thrown out of the stack. |\n| `throwoutend` | When card has been thrown out of the stack and the animation has ended. |\n| `throwoutleft` | Shorthand for `throwout` event in the `Card.DIRECTION_LEFT` direction. |\n| `throwoutright` | Shorthand for `throwout` event in the `Card.DIRECTION_RIGHT` direction. |\n| `throwin` | When card has been thrown into the stack. |\n| `throwinend` | When card has been thrown into the stack and the animation has ended. |\n| `dragstart` | Hammer [panstart](http://hammerjs.github.io/recognizer-pan/). |\n| `dragmove` | Hammer [panmove](http://hammerjs.github.io/recognizer-pan/). |\n| `dragend` | Hammer [panend](http://hammerjs.github.io/recognizer-pan/). |\n\n### Event Object\n\nEvent listener is invoked with a single `eventObject` parameter:\n\n```js\nvar stack;\n\nstack = stack = Swing.Stack();\n\nstack.on('throwout', function (eventObject) {});\n```\n\n| Name | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| `target` | The element being dragged. |\n| `direction` | The direction in which the element is being dragged: `Card.DIRECTION_LEFT` or `Card.DIRECTION_RIGHT`. |\n| `throwOutConfidence` | A value between 0 and 1 indicating the completeness of the throw out condition. |\n\n## Download\n\nUsing [Bower](http://bower.io/):\n\n```sh\nbower install swing\n```\n\nUsing [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/):\n\n```sh\nnpm install swing\n```\n\n### Browser Bundle\n\nWhen using the `./dist/` version the Swing resides under `gajus` namespace:\n\n```js\nvar stack = gajus.Swing.Stack();\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n\nIf you are using the `./dist/` version, you do not need to download the dependencies.\n\nThe list of the dependencies and description of their role is for your reference only.\n\n* [Rebound](http://facebook.github.io/rebound-js/docs/rebound.html) to drive physical animations. Notice how if you drag too little and let go, the cards spring back into place.\n* [Hammer](http://hammerjs.github.io/) to handle drag interactions.\n",
